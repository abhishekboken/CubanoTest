As a test automation engineer
I need to find if a person is the citizen of New Zealand

## Acceptance Criteria
* The link to NZ website should be accessible 

## [NZ Citizenship Status Check](-)
Given I have opened New Zealand Government Website
When I answer all the questions asked
Then I can confirm the expected status: [You are not a New Zealand citizen but you may meet the requirements for NZ citizenship] (- "?=govtNZ()")
